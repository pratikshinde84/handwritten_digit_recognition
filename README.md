🧾 Project Description

This project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition System that identifies digits (0–9) from input images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The model takes a grayscale image of a handwritten digit, processes it through multiple convolutional and pooling layers, and predicts the corresponding digit with high accuracy.

The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model development, OpenCV for image preprocessing, and NumPy for data handling.

Technologies & Algorithms Used:

Dataset: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model Format: H5 (saved using Keras model saving)
